## Project 1: House Price Estimation

**Overview:**
In this project, I've developed a machine learning model to predict house prices using linear regression. The Jupyter notebook contains the following key components:
- Data Preprocessing
- Data Visualization
- Conversion of Categorical Features to Numeric
- Min-Max Scaling of Numeric Features
- Data Splitting (Train-Test)
- Model Building (Linear Regression)
- Evaluation Metrics Calculation
- Making Predictions on New Data

The code for this project is available in the House Price Prediction.ipynb file.
