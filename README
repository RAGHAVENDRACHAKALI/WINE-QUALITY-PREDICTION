Project 2: Wine Quality Assessment

**Overview:**
This project is dedicated to predicting the quality of wine using both linear regression and random forest models. The Jupyter notebook includes the following stages:
- Data Preprocessing
- Data Visualization
- Data Oversampling for Quality Balance
- Data Splitting (Train-Test)
- Model Creation (Linear Regression and Random Forest)
- Evaluation Metrics Computation for Both Models
- Utilizing the Random Forest Model for Predictions on New Data

You can find the code for this project in the Wine Quality.ipynb file.
